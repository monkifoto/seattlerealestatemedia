      <p class="subtitle">
        Aerial photography and video have become increasingly popular in the
        real estate industry due to their ability to provide a unique
        perspective of a property. With the help of drones we can capture
        stunning footage from high above, showcasing a property's unique selling
        features from a bird's-eye view. <br /><br />
        By providing a visual representation of the property and its
        surroundings, aerial photography and video can help potential buyers get
        a better idea of what the property has to offer. This is especially
        useful for showcasing a property's location, proximity to amenities, and
        natural surroundings. By capturing footage of the surrounding
        neighborhood and landmarks from above, agents can help potential buyers
        get a better understanding of the property's location and its unique
        surroundings.

        <br /><br />
        Million dollar properties with waterfront views, acreage and
        one-of-a-kind land features can all be highlighted and showcased with
        aerial/drone photography and video.
