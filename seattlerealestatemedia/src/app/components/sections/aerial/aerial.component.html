        <h2 class='pageHeader'>AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO</h2>
        <p>
          Aerial photography and video have become increasingly popular in the real estate industry due to their ability to provide a unique perspective of a property. With the help of drones we can capture stunning footage from high above, showcasing a property's unique selling features from a bird's-eye view.
          <br/><br/>
By providing a visual representation of the property and its surroundings, aerial photography and video can help potential buyers get a better idea of what the property has to offer. For example, if the property has a large backyard or a swimming pool, aerial footage can show the full extent of these features, giving buyers a better sense of the space available.
<br/><br/>
Furthermore, aerial photography and video can be especially useful for showcasing a property's location, proximity to amenities, and natural surroundings. By capturing footage of the surrounding neighborhood and landmarks from above, agents can help potential buyers get a better understanding of the property's location and its unique surroundings.

          <br/><br/>
          Million dollar properties with waterfront views, acreage and one-of-a-kind land features can all be
          highlighted and showcased with aerial/drone photography and video.
