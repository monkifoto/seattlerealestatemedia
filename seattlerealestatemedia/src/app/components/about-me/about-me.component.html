        <p>
          During my time at Sammamish Highschool, I discovered my passion for photography and began my career in the field.
          I was offered a sales position at Kit's Camera, where I soon found myself working in the 1-hour photo booth.
          It was there that I nurtured my love for developing and printing photos.
          In fact, it's possible that I may have printed some of your own photos during the film era in places like Factoria, Issaquah, South Center, and Klahanie. <br />
          <br />
          Over the years, shooting a variety of events, weddings, commercial
          products, I came to the realization that my passion is photographing
          architecture and interiors.
